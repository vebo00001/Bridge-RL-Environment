## Run instructions 

* For testing the environment, just run the python file you can change the actions too in the file and possibly extend it to parse from json file in future.  

```
 python3 agent.py

 ```

* Refer to the dqn_agent.py and model.py files for construction of single agent deep q network. 

* INCOMPLETE: The dimensionality input to the neural networks is yet to be determined for DQN from the environment, which should probably be the next steps.
